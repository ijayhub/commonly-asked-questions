- **Q:** I want to start web development but I don't know how to start.

**A:** Starting your journey into web development doesn't have to be difficult. Many developers learn on their own without formal education. According to Stack Overflow, less than half of all developers have a computer science degree, and about 70% are at least partly self-taught. This means you can learn web development on your own!

For more clarity and guidance, you can watch this video:

It provides a comprehensive introduction to getting started with web development.

- **Q:** I don't know Math, can I still learn to code?

**A:** Yes, you can learn to code without being good at math! I used to think that I couldn't be a programmer because I wasn't great at math in school. However, I realized that programming is more about logical thinking and problem-solving than complex math.

Most areas of coding, like web development, don’t require advanced math skills. So, don’t let that hold you back.

- **Q:** Will AI replace developers?

**A:**  Many developers worry that AI will take over their jobs, but this isn't true. AI is a tool designed to help, not replace, developers. If you know what you're doing, AI will make your work easier by handling repetitive tasks and refining your code.

AI has been around for a while and is used in many fields, not just tech. It helps improve productivity, but human developers are still needed for creativity.

Don’t let concerns about AI stop you from learning to code. Embrace AI as a helpful tool in your development journey.

- Q:  Is it possible to learn to code without spending money?
A: Absolutely, you can learn to code for free. There are many online resources available. For instance, I used [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) when I started. I appreciated it because it offers a structured curriculum and allows interaction with other developers.

Note: This is not a paid; I just personally like their platform.

- Q: How do I fetch data from an API?

A: You can fetch data from an API using JavaScript with the fetch function. Here’s a simple example:

```
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
```
This code sends a request to the specified API URL, converts the response to JSON, and logs the data to the console.
